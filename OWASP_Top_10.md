# OWASP Top 10 - Short Descriptions

## 1. Broken Access Control
Access control policies are not properly enforced, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform actions outside their permissions.

## 2. Cryptographic Failures
Inadequate encryption or improper cryptographic implementations that expose sensitive data, such as passwords or personal information.

## 3. Injection
Unsanitized input is sent to an interpreter (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, LDAP), leading to unintended execution of commands and data breaches.

## 4. Insecure Design
Flaws in system architecture or business logic that create security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for security considerations during design.

## 5. Security Misconfiguration
Improper security settings in applications, databases, or servers that leave systems vulnerable to attacks.

## 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
Use of outdated or unpatched third-party libraries, frameworks, or software, increasing exposure to known vulnerabilities.

## 7. Identification and Authentication Failures
Weak authentication mechanisms, improper session management, or flawed multi-factor authentication that allow unauthorized access.

## 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
Lack of verification for critical software updates, libraries, or data, leading to potential injection of malicious code or unauthorized modifications.

## 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
Insufficient logging and monitoring of security events, reducing the ability to detect and respond to attacks effectively.

## 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
An attacker tricks a server into making unauthorized requests to internal or external resources, potentially leading to data leaks or further exploitation.
